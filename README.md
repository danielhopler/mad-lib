# Counting the Number of Characters

### Problem Statement:
- Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb,
and an adjective and injects those into a story that you create

- Example Output:
```
	Enter a noun: dog
​ 	Enter a verb: walk
​ 	Enter an adjective: blue
​ 	Enter an adverb: quickly
​ 	Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!
```


##### Inputs - inputNoun, inputVerb, inputAdverb, inputAdjective
##### Processes - inject inputs  into story string
##### Output - story with injected input

### Constraints:
- Use single output statement
- If your language supports string interpolation or string substitution, use it to build up the output.  >> Use Template Literals or .replace() method

### Challenge(s):
- Add more inputs to the program to expand the story.
- Implement a branching story, where the answers to questions determine how the story is constructed (if statements; forks in the road, basically). You'll explore this concept more in the problems in Chapter 4, (*Making Decisions*)

### Pseudocode:
	- Mad Lib
		- initialize inputNoun to "";
		- initialize inputVerb to "";
		- initialize inputAdverb to "";
		- initialize inputAdjective to "";
		- initialize userStory to equal string with blanks:

		- Prompt for inputNoun;
		- Prompt for inputVerb;
		- Prompt for inputAdverb;
		- Prompt for inputAdjective;
